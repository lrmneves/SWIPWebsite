<div class="aboutswip">
<p class="aboutswip2">Founded in 2012 by Caroline Simon ('14), Adrienne Fishman ('14),
Tara Kheradpir ('14), and Julia Tishman ('15), SWIP is focused on facilitating discussion and
debate about current events in a comfortable environment. In weekly Monday meetings
we strive to educate our members about domestic and international affairs. Our mantra
"any woman, any study" is a testament to the types of members we attract--from all colleges, backgrounds,
political affiliations, and personal interests. <br><br> Join us for weekly meetings Mondays at 6pm in
Willard Straight Hall Room 604.<br></p>
